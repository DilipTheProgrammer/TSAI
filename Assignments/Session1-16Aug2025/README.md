# TSAI Projects

## Project 1 â€” The School of AI

### Assignment 1A: Chrome Plugin Development using Cursor.ai

#### Overview  
In this session, we explore 1â€“2 examples of using Cursor to create Chrome Extensions. You are encouraged to get creative and build something unique!

#### Example Ideas  
- Find and list the latest movies on Netflix  
- Find the next Cricket Match or F1 Grand Prix  
- Change the font on any website to your liking  
- Create a clipboard that stores all "copy" texts in your browser  
- Develop a small web browser-based game  

#### Important Notes  
- Limit development time to **no more than 1 hour** to avoid getting addicted  
- Start from scratch rather than fixing a large existing project  
- Improve your prompt with each iteration  

#### Submission Instructions  
1. Upload a short video of your extension working on YouTube  
   _(Use tools like Snip & Sketch, OBS, etc. to capture video)_  
2. Zip your project folder and share the code  
3. Optionally, share your work on LinkedIn for **200 bonus points!**  

#### Motivation  
Sharing publicly puts healthy design and aesthetic pressure on you, as feedback and critique help you improve.  
_Remember:_  
> When you stop expecting appreciation and make yourself your own benchmark, the world will start appreciating.

**Correct answer:** *Same order*  

### Question 8 (10 pts)  
**What determines how many features we should extract?**  
- Depends on how capable our training hardware is  
- Depends on how varied our dataset and problem statement is  
- How many features are actually there in the images/dataset  
- Depends on how capable our deployment hardware is  
- Depends on how rich we are (so we can afford better hardware)  

**Correct answer:** *All of the above*  

### Question 9 (10 pts)  
**Select the ones that are TRUE:**  
- Kernels and channels are the same things  
- Receptive field of the last layer should be at least equal to the size of the image  
- Total number of channels is determined by the total number of kernels in a convolutional neural network  
- The attention span of a transformer NLP model must be equal to the complete length of the input  

**Correct answers:**  
- Receptive field of the last layer should be at least equal to the size of the image  
- Total number of channels is determined by the total number of kernels in a CNN  
- The attention span of a transformer NLP model must be equal to the complete length of the input  

### Question 10 (10 pts)  
**Select the ones that are FALSE:**  
- The 9 values in a 3x3 kernel are the values which our neural network learns  
- When we convolve, we element-wise multiply the 9 values of the kernel with the 9 values of the image/channel, then sum them to get a single value  
- We use 3x3s because that is what is optimized for speed on most hardware  
- We use 3x3 because 9 is the luckiest number in the world!  

**Correct answer:** *We use 3x3 because 9 is the luckiest number in the world!*

# Additional Questions

## Q1. What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

**Answer:**  
- **Channels:** A channel is a bag of similar features. Objects with similar features/characteristics/properties can be considered one channel.  
  _Example:_ In vegetable biryani, all peas can be one channel, all carrots another, etc.  

- **Kernels:** Kernels are feature extractors that perform convolution over the image to extract features.  
  _Example:_ In the biryani example, the observer who differentiates peas, carrots, rice is the kernel.  

## Q2. Why should we only (mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?

**Answer:**  
- 3x3 kernels help build anything we want efficiently.  
- Big companies like NVIDIA, INTEL, and AMD hardware-accelerate 3x3 kernels.  
- 3x3 kernels are odd-sized, providing symmetry with a center line, unlike even-sized kernels.  

## Q3. How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolutions to reach 1x1 from 199x199?  

**Answer:**  
- 99 times
