# TSAI_Projects

## Project 1 for The School of AI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### *Assignment 1A: Chrome Plugin development using Cursor.ai*
#### Overview
In this session, we explor 1-2 examples of using Cussor to create Chrome Extensions. We are encouraged to get creative and build something unique!

### Example Ideas
- Find and list the latest movies on Netflix
- Find the next Cricket Match or F1 Grand Prix
- Change the font on any website to your liking
- Create a clipboard that stores all "copy" texts in your browser
- Develop a small web browser-based game

### Important Notes
- Limit your development time to no more than 1 hour to avoid getting too addicted!
- Start from scratch rather than trying to fix something big.
- Improve your prompt with each iteration.

### Submission Instructions
1. Upload a short video of your extension working on YouTube (use tools like Snip & Sketch, OBS, etc. to capture video).
2. Zip your project folder and share the code.
3. Optionally, share your work on LinkedIn for 200 bonus points!

### Motivation
Sharing publicly puts healthy design and aesthetics pressure on you, as feedback and critique help you improve. Remember the wise words:  
_When you stop expecting appreciation and make yourself your own benchmark, the world will start appreciating._

### *Assignment 1B: Quiz*


# Quiz Results

**Score for this quiz:** 50.33 out of 90  
**Submitted:** Aug 17 at 2:59am  
**This attempt took:** 9 minutes

#### Question 1 (10 pts)  
**Select the odd one out**  
- Channel
- a 11x11 matrix that is used to slide or convolve on an image  
- Kernel  
- Feature Extractor  
- a 3x3 matrix that is used to slide or convolve on an image  
### Correct answer : *Channel*

---


#### Question 2 (10 pts)  
**What should be the receptive field of the kernels in the last layer?**  
*(If we were talking about text, then this question would be, how many words of input shall the last layer "see" (or read/know of) to be able to predict/summarize or do anything productive)*  
- 400x400  
- Equal to the size of the image  
- Equal to the size of the kernel  
- Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  
### Correct answer : *Equal to the size of the image*

---

 
#### Question 3 (10 pts)  
**What should be the attention span of a transformer model, about to predict the next word?**  
- Last few words  
- Last word  
- As long as the length of all the words encountered till now  
- Half of the length of all the words encountered till now  
### Correct answer: *As long as the length of all the words encountered till now*

---

#### Question 4 (10 pts)  
**What are channels?**  
- Output of kernels  
- Output of Fully connected layer  
- Collection of Kernels  
- A collection of neurons that hold contextually similar information  
### Correct answer: *Output of kernels*
---


#### Question 5 (10 pts)  
**I'm loving ERA V4 course!**  
- True ðŸ˜€  
- True ðŸ˜€  
- Definitely True ðŸ˜€  
### Correct answer: *WHATEVER YOU FEEl (I Put Definitely True, but was marked wrong ðŸ˜€)*
---

#### Question 6 (10 pts)  
**Match the following!**  
- **Starting Features:** Edges and Gradients  
- **Slightly complex feature:** Texture and Patterns  
- **More complex feature:** Parts of Objects  
- **Very complex feature:** Objects 

### Correct answer : <br/> *Starting Features = Edges and Gradients <br/> Slightly complex feature = Textures and Patterns <br/> More complex feature = Part of Objects <br/> Very complex feature = Objects*


---

#### Question 7 (10 pts)  
**Match the Following**  
- **Starting Features:** Characters  
- **Slightly complex feature:** Words  
- **More complex feature:** Sentences  
- **Very complex feature:** Stories  
### Correct answer : *Same order*


---

#### Question 8 (10 pts)  
**What determines how many features we should extract?**  
- Depends on how capable our training hardware is!  
- Depends on how varied our dataset and problem statement is!  
- How many features are actually there in the images/dataset  
- Depends on how capable our deployment hardware it!  
- Depends on how rich we are (so we can afford better hardware)  
### Correct answer : *All of the above*
---


#### Question 9 (10 pts)  
**Select the ones that are TRUE:**  
- Kernels and channels are the same things  
- Receptive field of the last layer should be at least equal to the size of the image  
- Total number of channels is determined by the total number of kernels in a convolutional neural network  
- The attention span of a transformer NLP model must be equal to the complete length of the input  
### Correct answers  <br/> *Receptive field of the last layer should be atleast equal to the size of the image;* <br/>
  *Total number of channels is determined by the total number of kernels in a convolutional neural network;* <br/>
  *The attention span of a transformer NLP model must be equal to the complete length of the input;* <br/>

### Correct Answers  
- Receptive field of the last layer should be at least equal to the size of the image  
- Total number of channels is determined by the total number of kernels in a convolutional neural network  
- The attention span of a transformer NLP model must be equal to the complete length of the input  



#### Question 10 (10 pts)  
**Select the ones that are False:**  
- The 9 values we have in a 3x3 kernel are the values which our neural network needs to learn!  
- When we convolve, we element-wise multiply the 9 values of the kernel with the 9 values of the image/channel, and then add them together to get a single value  
- We use 3x3s because that is what is optimized for speed on most hardware  
- We use 3x3 because 9 is the luckiest number in the world!  
### Correct answer  <br/> : *We use 3x3 because 9 is the luckiest number in the world!*
