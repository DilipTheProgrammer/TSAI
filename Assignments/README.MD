## Project 1 for The School of AI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### *Assignment 1A: Chrome Plugin development using Cursor.ai*
#### Overview
In this session, we explor 1-2 examples of using Cussor to create Chrome Extensions. We are encouraged to get creative and build something unique!

### Example Ideas
- Find and list the latest movies on Netflix
- Find the next Cricket Match or F1 Grand Prix
- Change the font on any website to your liking
- Create a clipboard that stores all "copy" texts in your browser
- Develop a small web browser-based game

### Important Notes
- Limit your development time to no more than 1 hour to avoid getting too addicted!
- Start from scratch rather than trying to fix something big.
- Improve your prompt with each iteration.

### Submission Instructions
1. Upload a short video of your extension working on YouTube (use tools like Snip & Sketch, OBS, etc. to capture video).
2. Zip your project folder and share the code.
3. Optionally, share your work on LinkedIn for 200 bonus points!

### Motivation
Sharing publicly puts healthy design and aesthetics pressure on you, as feedback and critique help you improve. Remember the wise words:  
_When you stop expecting appreciation and make yourself your own benchmark, the world will start appreciating._
