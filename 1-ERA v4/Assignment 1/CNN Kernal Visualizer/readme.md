#### Important Notes  
- Limit development time to **no more than 1 hour** to avoid getting addicted  
- Start from scratch rather than fixing a large existing project  
- Improve your prompt with each iteration  

#### Submission Instructions  
1. Upload a short video of your extension working on YouTube  
   _(Use tools like Snip & Sketch, OBS, etc. to capture video)_  
2. Zip your project folder and share the code  
3. Optionally, share your work on LinkedIn for **200 bonus points!**  

#### Motivation  
Sharing publicly puts healthy design and aesthetic pressure on you, as feedback and critique help you improve.  
_Remember:_  
> When you stop expecting appreciation and make yourself your own benchmark, the world will start appreciating.
