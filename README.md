# The School of AI
## Program Name: ERA V4
## Commencement Date: 16 Aug 2025


Objective for The School of AI ERA v4 Program: 
### |1.| Real-World, Full-Scale LLM Training
### |2.| Training a 70B model end-to-end + instruction tuning with QAT and hands-on compute. 
### |3.| Practical CoreSet Focus - Not just learning about the right “datasets” - but learning CoreSet thinking, which is at the bleeding edge of data efficiency.
### Multi-GPU ImageNet Training - Training from scratch on full ImageNet with real training and deployment experience.
### Quantization Aware Training (QAT) Covering full QAT, not just LoRA/PEFT, as a massive differentiator - real engineering, not shortcuts. Laying foundations to train a 100B+ parameter model!!
### Balanced Inclusion of RL + VLMs + Embeddings

Capturing most of the modern modalities and methods: vision, language, reward, embeddings - with deployment in mind.
