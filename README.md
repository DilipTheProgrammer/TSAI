### ERA V4 Course Objectives

| S.No. | Objective | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Real-World, Full-Scale LLM Training | Gain hands-on experience training a large-scale (70B parameter) model end-to-end, including instruction tuning, with a focus on practical exposure to compute and optimization challenges. |
| 2 | Practical CoreSet Focus | Understand and apply the principles of CoreSet selection and data efficiency, moving beyond just dataset exposure to strategies that maximize model performance with fewer resources. |
| 3 | Multi-GPU ImageNet Training | Develop practical skills in distributed training by training on the full ImageNet dataset across multiple GPUs, simulating real-world research lab conditions. |
| 4 | Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) | Learn QAT as a first-class method for scaling models efficiently, gaining the ability to train and deploy models with 100B+ parameters while considering deployment constraints. |
| 5 | Balanced Exposure to RL, VLMs, and Embeddings | Explore reinforcement learning, vision-language models, and embeddings in a balanced way, covering modern modalities and techniques with an emphasis on practical deployment. |
