Objective for The School of AI ERA v4 Program: 


## Course Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Real-World, Full-Scale LLM Training | Gain hands-on experience training a large-scale (70B parameter) model end-to-end, including instruction tuning, with a focus on practical exposure to compute and optimization challenges. |
| Practical CoreSet Focus | Understand and apply the principles of CoreSet selection and data efficiency, moving beyond just dataset exposure to strategies that maximize model performance with fewer resources. |
| Multi-GPU ImageNet Training | Develop practical skills in distributed training by training on the full ImageNet dataset across multiple GPUs, simulating real-world research lab conditions. |
| Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) | Learn QAT as a first-class method for scaling models efficiently, gaining the ability to train and deploy models with 100B+ parameters while considering deployment constraints. |
| Balanced Exposure to RL, VLMs, and Embeddings | Explore reinforcement learning, vision-language models, and embeddings in a balanced way, covering modern modalities and techniques with an emphasis on practical deployment. |

|1.| Real-World, Full-Scale LLM Training |
|2.| Training a 70B model end-to-end + instruction tuning with QAT and hands-on compute. 
### |3.| Practical CoreSet Focus - Not just learning about the right “datasets” - but learning CoreSet thinking, which is at the bleeding edge of data efficiency.
### Multi-GPU ImageNet Training - Training from scratch on full ImageNet with real training and deployment experience.
### Quantization Aware Training (QAT) Covering full QAT, not just LoRA/PEFT, as a massive differentiator - real engineering, not shortcuts. Laying foundations to train a 100B+ parameter model!!
### Balanced Inclusion of RL + VLMs + Embeddings

Capturing most of the modern modalities and methods: vision, language, reward, embeddings - with deployment in mind.
